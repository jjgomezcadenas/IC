diomira ="""
Leaving there and proceeding for three days toward the east, you reach Diomira, 
a city with sixty silver domes, bronze statues of all the gods, streets paved with lead, 
a crystal theater, a golden cock that crows every morning on a tower. 
All these beauties will already be familiar to the visitor, 
who has seen them also in other cities. 
But the special quality of this city for the man who arrives there on a September evening, 
when the days are growing shorter 
and the multicolored lamps are lighted all at once at the doors of the food stalls 
and from a terrace a woman's voice cries ooh!, is that he feels envy 
toward those who now believe they have once before lived an 
evening identical to this and who think they were happy, that time."""
